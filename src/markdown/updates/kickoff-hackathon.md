Join us as we launch the first ever city-wide chapter of Code The Change in Calgary.
We want to celebrate this day by hosting a kickoff party and mini hackathon.
The central theme of this event will be Climate Action.
It's going to be a jam-packed, collaborative learning experience with a chance to work with
industry experts and local non-profits.
