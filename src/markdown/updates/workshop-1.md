While we are a student-led initiative consisting of members with
beginner-intermediate experience, we
are committed in ensuring that the projects we produce are of the highest quality possible.
To equip our members better, we are hosting workshops that tackle some of the most important
fundamental aspects in Software Development.

In this workshop, members will get a feel on how to gather the business problems brought
on by a project and translate that into a problem better understood from a software
developer standpoint. We will also be covering how to approach an agile software
development workflow to improve efficiency and collaboration.
